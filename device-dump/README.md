### How To Dump Your Device To Request A New Port

- get a recent TWRP running on your device.
- copy 'repit-dump.zip' to your device and flash it.
- pull to your PC a file called 'repit-dump.log' that was generated in the same folder that holds 'repit-dump.zip'.
- go [here] (https://github.com/Lanchon/REPIT/issues/new) and create a new issue:
  - attach the pulled 'repit-dump.log' file.
  - add the following information:
    - your exact device and device codename.
    - your recovery (version? official? if not where did you get it?).
    - your kernel.
    - your rom.

thank you!
