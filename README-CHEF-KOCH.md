## The CHEF-KOCH Incident (And XDA's Response)

the following information remains online because, to this date, CHEF-KOCH has not publicly acknowledged his act
of plagiarism. our latest exchange can be found [here] (https://github.com/Lanchon/REPIT/issues/37).

> **AND WHAT IS THIS?**

> what follows is text originally posted by me on XDA. the strange incident that was the subject of this post was
investigated by moderators from both of the involved sites and found to be as i described it. as a result, proper
corrective measures were implemented.
>
>unfortunately this post was later surreptitiously deleted by XDA moderator [The_Merovingian]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5302753), an action that precipitated my departure from the XDA
community as a developer. i no longer consider XDA a viable medium for hosting my work.
>
> the post is now reproduced here for record keeping in the form in which it was when it was deleted from XDA by
The_Merovingian on February 23, 2016.

> **UPDATE:** as a sort of retaliation for my moving REPIT out of XDA, The_Merovingian closed down
[the REPIT thread] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747)
([via Wayback Machine] (https://web.archive.org/web/20160226151111/http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747)).
this was unfortunate because the thread got 30 pages of posts in its 2 weeks of existence, and probably was
the second most active thread in the S2 forum. all this traffic then went on to spam the official i9100 CM13 thread,
already drowning in off-topic noise; it was a mess.

> clearly XDA members needed a place to discuss REPIT but XDA did not really care about this. 
The_Merovingian told me that i needed to "remove [the rant]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747/post65239832)"
in order for the thread to be reopened. i reached out to the XDA moderation committee asking for the
official position on whether "DUE TO IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERENCES" constituted an unacceptable rant on XDA.
i am still waiting for a response... :)

> censorship attempts typically backfire on the internet. what was to be a post on a forum is now inextricably
linked to the history of an open source project in its git repo, cloned by anyone needing the tool's tree.

> After all is said and done, all the trouble caused and the time lost, i have but one personal message
to The_Merovingian, and it is this: the matrix is a silly franchise.

_we interrupt your regular programming to bring you this breaking news..._

### _"CHEF-KOCH" IS A THIEF !!!_

> **UPDATE:** moderators from both [the german forum] (http://www.android-hilfe.de/) and xda collaborated to resolve this
issue. they were alerted by some forum members who are active in both communities (and again i thank you guys for
that, you know who you are). after a swift investigation, and just two days after this silliness started, they
removed all offending content from the german site and placed a link to this thread in its place. i am very grateful
to all the parties that quickly put this issue to rest.

> **2ND UPDATE:** i was told that this guy's account at the german site was terminated; the reasons for this are unknown
to me. and user [the.gangster] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=6560258) was put in charge of the
repartition thread there. thank you for taking over!

> **3RD UPDATE:** i privately told the.gangster a few days ago when this guy was banned from the german site that i
wanted to remove the guy's contact details from this post and let bygones be bygones. unfortunately this guy is
relentless: he can no longer post, but still he added text files on his MEGA instead accusing **me** of stealing
and other nonsense. well, so be it: this info stays online forever, and so do his contact details. i removed the
fowl language to comply with XDA requirements and the rest stays.

_it is unbelievable!!! this_ [epithet removed] _took my just-published software, removed the license, removed my
name, removed the copyright, added himself as the author, and republished it in a [german forum]
(http://www.android-hilfe.de/thema/how-to-vergroesserung-der-datenpartition-mittels-bearbeitetem-pit-file-teil-2.751812/)
as his own work. (here is the same link [via Wayback Machine]
(https://web.archive.org/web/20160213014929/http://www.android-hilfe.de/thema/how-to-vergroesserung-der-datenpartition-mittels-bearbeitetem-pit-file-teil-2.751812/),
in case the_ [epithet removed] _decides to delete his post.) when i dated one of my zips in its name, he copied
that too, except that he rewinded the date by one day. but he forgot to fake the modification time of the files
inside the zip; and of course the upload date in MEGA is the real one. he also republished the older v0.1 unfinished release i did to help people in a tight spot with CM13, even though that release **was not free software**. (it was
specifically **not** licensed as free software to avoid copies of the unfinished work spreading around; however the
current version is GPLv3.) he also stole [Flashize]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/tool-flashize-shell-scripts-flashable-t3313605),
another tool i published these days._

_the plagiarized files are currently published [here] (https://mega.nz/#F!cMNShQLa!5lXzEuluHX9jd9Bv3B_h8Q), but might
be removed anytime. a copy of all files was [uploaded to post #3]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747/post65239837)_
[now also surreptitiously deleted from XDA! rehosted [here] (https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=50817)]
_for record keeping._

_i did delete my old published v0.1 files from xda, but fortunately i did not delete some customized versions of
v0.1 that i produced on request that are still available [here]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747/post65252583)
and [here] (http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/orig-development/tool-lanchon-repit-data-sparing-t3311747/post65252738).
most importantly, i [announced]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/development-derivatives/rom-cyanogenmod-13-t3223808/post65201096)
that i was working on a partitioning tool and 6 hours later [published]
(http://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s2/development-derivatives/rom-cyanogenmod-13-t3223808/post65206132)
the full complex log of a working, pre-release version of the application. that was 3 full days before the_
[epithet removed] _published "his" software... lol._

#### _WHO IS THIS "CHEF-KOCH"_ [epithet removed] _THIEF ANYWAY ???_

[rant removed.]

_it is very unlikely that this is the only time he has done this, and i can tell you this is very demotivating for a developer. so protect your developers by helping them expose this clown in case they happen to cross paths with him. also, his clients and/or employers better know what kind of "work" this guy does._
